// The front-door route table: the ONE statement of how a request that reaches
// a Planton platform at its public origin is routed to a component. Every
// front door renders from it -- the Ingress object, the Gateway API HTTPRoute,
// and the built-in nginx gateway that serves over kubectl port-forward -- so
// the three doors are the same architecture at different addresses, and a
// route added here appears on all of them in one change.
//
// Every rule is a plain path prefix with the segment-wise meaning Kubernetes
// defines as portable (Ingress pathType Prefix, Gateway API PathPrefix). That
// is why the browser API has a path namespace of its own (APIPathPrefix): a
// raw gRPC request path is a single segment, /ai.planton.<Service>/<Method>,
// which no portable prefix rule can tell from a console page -- it took a
// controller-specific regex to route, and a controller that does not know the
// regex sends every API call to the console. The control plane serves its
// gRPC-Web door under the same prefix, and the console is handed a base URL
// that ends with it, so no client composes the shape.
//
// Native gRPC clients (the CLI, the runner, any grpc-go or grpc-java program)
// cannot use a path namespace: their request path IS the single segment, fixed
// by the protocol. What they do carry, always, is the header the protocol
// requires -- "content-type: application/grpc" -- and an exact header match is
// a core, portable Gateway API rule. So one rule matches the root prefix
// together with that header and delivers to the control plane's raw gRPC port.
// The Gateway API's precedence order (longer path prefix first, then the rule
// with more header matches) keeps the browser API's and identity's prefixes
// ahead of it and puts it ahead of the console's catch-all. The framed-gRPC
// path through the gRPC-Web door is deliberately not offered: that door exists
// to translate for browsers, and a native client behind it loses its trailers
// on the way back.
//
// A remote runner's work calls (Temporal's worker methods) are native gRPC
// too, and they take the same rule: the control plane serves them itself,
// authenticating the runner's key on every call and admitting it only to its
// own queues, dispatched work, and polled tasks. No rule of this table reaches
// Temporal; its frontend never leaves the cluster.
//
// The Ingress object and the nginx gateway have no portable header match, so
// they render the path-only rules and skip this one; on those doors a native
// client reaches the control plane through a port-forward to its raw gRPC
// port, and the README says so.
//
// The control plane's webhook port is the fourth backend: the keyless issuer's
// two discovery documents at the root the specification pins them to, and the
// inbound webhooks under a namespace of their own (see WebhooksPathPrefix). It
// is routed on every door, the port-forward one included, so the discovery
// document a developer fetches at http://localhost:8080 is honest about the
// door it is served at.
//
// Order is most-specific first. Renderers that match by longest prefix (the
// Ingress, the Gateway API) do not depend on it; nginx does not either
// (longest-prefix location wins), but the rendered config reads in the same
// order as this table.
