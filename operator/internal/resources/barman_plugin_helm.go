// of this plugin, so a cluster with no plugin cannot back itself up -- and a
// cluster that DECLARES a backup with no plugin on the cluster is parked by
// the operator in its "unknown plugin" phase with no instances at all.
//
// The plugin is a shared cluster capability, exactly like CloudNativePG
// itself: one release, in CloudNativePG's own namespace (the operator
// discovers plugins only through Services in its own namespace), serving
// every PostgreSQL cluster on the cluster -- the platform's own database and
// any database an adopter deploys through Planton. It is therefore installed
// and removed by the same detect-or-install gate and janitor the other shared
// sub-operators use, never as a platform-owned object.
//
// The chart bakes the plugin's gRPC Service name into its TLS certificate and
// fixes its two TLS Secrets, its Certificates and its config ConfigMap by name,
// so a second release in the same namespace would fight the first over all of
// them: the release name is a constant, and the identity pins below are
