// Package platformversion decides whether this operator can run the platform
// version a PlantonPlatform declares.
//
// The operator and the platform release on independent lines. What binds
// them is the boot contract: the environment the operator renders for the
// control plane, the runner, and the console, and the set of images it
// expects to exist for one version. When that contract changes, platform
// images released before the change cannot boot under the new operator, and
// without this package the only symptom is a crash-looping control plane
// with nothing said at the resource. The floor makes the pairing explicit:
// the operator names the oldest platform release it runs, refuses anything
// older before creating a single object, and says why in the resource's
// status.
//
// A declared version is judged strictly. plantond's definitions floor waves
// an unstamped ("dev", "local") build of ITSELF through, because a developer
// build is newer than any release by definition. That reasoning does not
// transfer here: spec.version is typed by a person for the platform, not
// reported by the running binary about itself, and the operator cannot tell
// "local" from a typo. Custom builds run at a release version with the
// per-component image.tag override, which the API defines as a mirror of
// the same version.

// MinimumSupported is the oldest platform release this operator runs: the
// oldest one whose control plane reads the settings this operator passes AND
// that was published whole (every platform image present for the tag).
//
// Raise it when the environment rendered for a platform component changes
// in a way an older platform image cannot tolerate -- a variable it requires,
// a variable it needs removed, a value whose meaning changed -- to the first
// release that reads the new shape. The boot-contract fixture test in
// internal/resources asks this question whenever the rendered variable names
// change; a variable older platforms simply ignore does not move the floor.
//
// v0.0.50: the control plane serves its browser-facing gRPC-Web API under the
// front-door path namespace (resources.APIPathPrefix) instead of at the
// origin root, and every front door this operator renders routes that
// namespace. An older control plane answers only at the root, so under this
// operator every console API call would 404.
//
// v0.0.56: the front door is the keyless identity issuer and declares its
// reachability, and the operator renders every internet-facing posture from
// it. Three reasons, any one of which moves the floor: the meaning of the
// keyless availability value changed (it used to be a literal "unavailable"
// with the catalog's generic sentence; it is now the door's verdict with the
// door's own reason, and an older catalog would show a reason it cannot
// explain); the control plane reads OIDC_ISSUER_URL and the per-cloud OAuth
// enabled flags only from this release, so an older one would keep minting
// the hosted issuer and offering sign-ins it has no app for; and the webhook
// receiver this operator advertises lives under the control plane's webhook
// namespace (resources.WebhooksPathPrefix), which an older control plane does
// not serve, so GitHub's deliveries would 404 at the door.
//
// v0.0.60: email is a declared capability, and invitations are links. The
// operator stops handing the control plane placeholder email credentials
// (RESEND_API_KEY and the two SENDGRID names) and the invitation URL base
// path, and renders PLANTON_EMAIL_PROVIDER=none instead; the control plane
// composes every invitation link from PLANTON_CONSOLE_URL. The same release
// accepts invitations as one synchronous write, so the operator also stops
// rendering the acceptance workflow's task queue
// (TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE_USER_INVITATION). An older control plane requires the
// placeholder key, the base path, and the queue name to boot at all, so under
// this operator it would never come up.
//
// v0.0.65: the control plane resolves official IaC modules at its own catalog
// release -- the same pin its schemas and chart bundle come from -- and the
// operator stops handing it a module version (the former PLANTON_VERSION,
// which this operator once compiled in as a constant three weeks behind the
// platform's catalog). The only variable in this area is now the per-install
// override PLANTON_INFRAHUB_IACMODULES_VERSION, rendered solely when the
// platform resource declares controlPlane.iacModulesVersion. An older control
// plane binds PLANTON_VERSION without a default and cannot boot without it,
// so under this operator it would never come up.
