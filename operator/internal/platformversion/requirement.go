// The contract between the operator and the platform is guarded in both
// directions. The floor (MinimumSupported) is the operator's side: the oldest
// platform release it renders for. The other side is the PLATFORM's to state:
// each platform release declares the oldest operator that serves it, as a
// label on its control-plane image, moved only when the platform starts
// depending on something a newer operator renders. The operator never carries
// a ceiling of its own -- "the newest platform I was built for" would refuse
// every platform release that changed nothing until an operator was
// re-released, an operator release per platform release, forever.
//
// Reading the requirement needs the registry, which an air-gapped install may
// not reach. The read is therefore best-effort: when it fails, the operator
// proceeds exactly as it did before this guard existed and says in its log
// that it could not check. The installer (desktop, CLI) enforces the same
// label before declaring, where the registry is always reachable.

// OperatorRelease is this operator's own release (vX.Y.Z), stamped at build
// time by the release workflow (-ldflags -X). A development build carries
// DevRelease and never refuses on the requirement: it cannot place itself on
