      # a deliberate catalog-wide decision, and floor-at-latest-released-minor
      # means the constraint never understates what any module's newest
      # argument needs. Only the sweep moves this line — never a single kind.

      # EXCEPT eks_properties' security_context.allow_privilege_escalation,
      # which the provider added in 6.29.0 (2026-01-28).
