      # monthly pin sweep last advanced it. The `~>` cap makes the next major
      # a deliberate catalog-wide decision, and floor-at-latest-released-minor
      # means the constraint never understates what any module's newest
      # argument needs. Only the sweep moves this line — never a single kind.

      # Feature floor 6.1.0: the earliest release whose vendored S3 SDK accepts every
      # enum value the spec allows — the FSx-flavored storage classes
      # (FSX_OPENZFS / FSX_ONTAP) and the aws:fsx encryption value land in
      # 6.1.0's SDK; the provider validates these client-side, so an older
      # provider would reject manifests using them. Everything else on
      # aws_s3_object predates the v6 line.
