      # monthly pin sweep last advanced it. The `~>` cap makes the next major
      # a deliberate catalog-wide decision, and floor-at-latest-released-minor
      # means the constraint never understates what any module's newest
      # argument needs. Only the sweep moves this line — never a single kind.

      # Feature floor 6.52.0: vpc_config.control_plane_egress_mode landed
      # there (this module's newest argument). Other recent surface this
      # module renders: control_plane_scaling_config 6.23.0 (tier-8xl value
      # 6.39.0), deletion_protection 6.9.0, remote_network_config in-place
      # updates 6.11.0 (remote_node_networks optional since 6.47.0).
