      # monthly pin sweep last advanced it. The `~>` cap makes the next major
      # a deliberate catalog-wide decision, and floor-at-latest-released-minor
      # means the constraint never understates what any module's newest
      # argument needs. Only the sweep moves this line — never a single kind.

      # Feature floor: cluster-level auto_minor_version_upgrade landed in
      # 6.54.0 (the newest argument this module renders); Serverless v2
      # automatic pause and database_insights_mode are late-v5 additions.
      # The 6.58 floor covers the whole modeled surface, including the
      # role-association, custom-endpoint, and activity-stream resources.
