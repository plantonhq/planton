      # a deliberate catalog-wide decision, and floor-at-latest-released-minor
      # means the constraint never understates what any module's newest
      # argument needs. Only the sweep moves this line — never a single kind.

      # Feature floor: PromQL alarms (evaluation_criteria +
      # evaluation_interval) landed in v6.42.0, but that release shipped a
      # plan-time regression (spurious "One of 'metric_name', 'metric_query',
      # or 'evaluation_criteria' must be set" errors) fixed in v6.43.0 — so
      # the floor deliberately skips the broken release.
