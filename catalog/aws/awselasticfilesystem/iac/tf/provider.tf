      # a deliberate catalog-wide decision, and floor-at-latest-released-minor
      # means the constraint never understates what any module's newest
      # argument needs. Only the sweep moves this line — never a single kind.

      # Feature floor: mount-target ip_address_type/ipv6_address
      # (dual-stack) landed in v6.12.0. Sibling AWS modules share the v6 line
      # so behavior never varies per kind.
