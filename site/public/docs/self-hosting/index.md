# Self-Hosting Planton

Planton runs entirely on your own Kubernetes cluster: the control plane, the web console, the identity server, the secrets manager, the databases, and an in-cluster runner — installed with two Helm commands (or one Planton CLI command), managed by a Kubernetes operator, reachable in minutes.

## Why self-host

Your infrastructure manifests, deployment history, secrets, and cloud credentials never leave your cluster. Self-hosting fits teams with data-residency requirements, air-gap-adjacent environments, or a platform team that wants Planton inside the same trust boundary as the infrastructure it manages.

## Install

Two commands install everything — the operator first, then the platform at the release you name:

```bash
helm install planton-operator oci://ghcr.io/plantonhq/charts/planton-operator \
  --namespace planton --create-namespace

helm install planton oci://ghcr.io/plantonhq/charts/planton \
  --namespace planton \
  --set platform.spec.version=v0.0.59
```

The first chart installs the Planton operator together with the `PlantonPlatform` definition it serves. The second creates one `PlantonPlatform` resource, and the operator reconciles the whole stack from that single resource: PostgreSQL, the workflow engine, the control plane, the console, the identity server, the secrets manager (OpenBAO, initialized automatically, storing in the platform's own database so one backup carries records and secrets together), and the in-cluster runner. No license key, no admin account, no database, and no values file are required — the one value is the platform release, because the chart pins none of its own. The published releases are the [control-plane image's tags](https://github.com/orgs/plantonhq/packages/container/package/planton%2Fcontrol-plane); an operator runs releases from a floor upward and refuses an older one on the resource with the floor named. The Planton desktop's guided install does the same two steps for you — operator chart, then the platform declared directly — preselecting the release the desktop shipped with, and hands you the manifest and commands to keep.

Watch it converge (typically 7–11 minutes):

```bash
kubectl get plantonplatform -n planton -w
```

Every component reports its own plain-language status on the resource — a stuck component names the problem and the fix in `kubectl describe plantonplatform`.

## Install through infrastructure as code

The same two steps exist as catalog resources, so an agent or a pipeline installs Planton the way it installs everything else: two manifests, applied in order, through OpenTofu or Pulumi. The operator kind installs the operator chart (and the `PlantonPlatform` definition it owns); the platform kind declares one platform against it.

```yaml
# planton-operator.yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.planton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KubernetesPlantonOperator
metadata:
  name: planton-operator
  annotations:
    planton.dev/provisioner: tofu      # or pulumi
spec:
  namespace:
    value: planton-operator
  create_namespace: true
---
# planton.yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.planton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KubernetesPlantonPlatform
metadata:
  name: planton
  annotations:
    planton.dev/provisioner: tofu      # or pulumi
spec:
  namespace:
    value: planton
  create_namespace: true
  version: v0.0.59
```

```bash
planton apply -f planton-operator.yaml
planton apply -f planton.yaml
```

The CLI downloads each kind's published module for its own release and runs the engine the annotation names; with `KUBECONFIG` pointing at the cluster, nothing else is configured for OpenTofu, and Pulumi additionally takes its state backend from the `pulumi.planton.dev/backend.url` annotation (with `pulumi.planton.dev/stack.fqdn` naming the stack). The operator kind's chart version and the platform kind's `version` are the two upgrade levers: change one and re-apply. The operator kind's two `crds` dials (`install`, `keep_on_uninstall`) govern whether the operator release installs the definitions and whether they survive its removal, both on by default. Field-by-field reference: the two kinds' pages in the open-source catalog, [KubernetesPlantonOperator](https://github.com/plantonhq/planton/tree/main/catalog/kubernetes/kubernetesplantonoperator) and [KubernetesPlantonPlatform](https://github.com/plantonhq/planton/tree/main/catalog/kubernetes/kubernetesplantonplatform), or the same kinds in the console's deployment-components store.

## First sign-in

The install's `NOTES` print the exact commands. In short:

```bash
kubectl -n planton port-forward svc/planton-gateway 8080:80
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. The first person to open the console becomes the administrator: enter your email plus the cluster setup code (the `NOTES` print the `kubectl` command that reads it — holding cluster access IS the admin proof), and receive a one-time password.

## Publish at your own URL

The built-in port-forward front door works on every cluster with zero configuration. Going public is a ladder of one field at a time on the `PlantonPlatform` resource:

```yaml
spec:
  ingress:
    enabled: true                      # auto-derives a working URL from your ingress controller
    hostname: planton.example.com      # or serve your own domain
    tls:
      issuer: {name: letsencrypt, kind: ClusterIssuer}   # cert-manager HTTPS
```

With `enabled: true` alone, the operator derives a magic-DNS hostname from your ingress controller's published address — a working URL with zero DNS setup, unique to the platform's name and namespace. The desktop app offers this whole journey as a guided experience: pick a cluster from your kubeconfig, preflight it, choose the front door, and watch the install converge — driving the exact same chart underneath.

## Several Plantons, one cluster

Platforms are namespaced, and one operator serves the whole cluster — it watches every namespace. Teams can run separate Planton platforms side by side (staging and production, or one per team), each fully confined to its own namespace:

```bash
# The operator is already on the cluster; every platform is one more release.
helm install planton oci://ghcr.io/plantonhq/charts/planton \
  --namespace planton-team-b --create-namespace
```

Never install two operators (the operator itself refuses to start beside another and says so), and give each platform its own namespace. Two cluster-level facts are shared by design: build events (the CI event stream Tekton delivers) can feed only one platform per cluster, and all platforms ride the one installed operator version — each platform still pins its own `spec.version`.

## Upgrades and uninstall

Config changes are edits to the `PlantonPlatform` resource; the operator reconciles them. The platform version is `spec.version` on that resource — `helm upgrade planton --set platform.spec.version=<version>` rolls the platform with its data intact. The operator upgrades through its own chart, and that chart carries the `PlantonPlatform` definition with it, so the schema always matches the operator that reads it. An operator runs platform releases from a floor upward: declare a version older than the oldest it supports and the resource goes to phase `Error` with the reason in its `MESSAGE` column, nothing is created, and a platform already running is left as it is — move the version, or install an operator release built for it.

`helm uninstall` removes the platform's workloads; data volumes deliberately survive. To remove everything including data, delete the namespace. The cluster-scoped badge-verification grant (`<namespace>-<name>-control-plane-token-reviewer`) is the one manual cleanup step of a full teardown.

## Requirements

- Kubernetes 1.24+, amd64 nodes (arm64 works only under emulation, e.g. local Docker Desktop)
- A default StorageClass whose storage driver is actually installed (or pin one via `spec.storage.storageClassName`)
- 6 GiB+ allocatable memory is comfortable; smaller evaluation clusters work with resource floors
