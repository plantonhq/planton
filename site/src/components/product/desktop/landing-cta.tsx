        Planton Desktop is free for individuals, including commercial use. Not a trial, not a tier with the good parts
        removed: the full catalog, the wizards, the IaC pipelines, service CI/CD, and secrets management are the core
        product on every edition.

      <BodyText className="mt-4 !text-base">
        Here is the business model, stated plainly. Planton makes its money when a team adopts it: hosted seats beyond
        the free {FREE_TIER_SEATS}, self-hosted licenses beyond the community edition&apos;s {COMMUNITY_SEAT_LIMIT}{' '}
        seats, and prepaid AI credits. The solo developer is not a funnel stage. You are the person this was built to
        delight, and if you one day bring a team, nothing you built gets redone.
