/**
 * The desktop landing page's screenshots, by the scene each one shows. Data,
 * not copy: a scene is a real capture of the product or nothing.
 *
 * Every image is a real capture of the app -- its own window chrome, taken
 * at 1440x900 on a Mac -- processed through the site's image pipeline and
 * served from the assets bucket under `landing/` (the media rule's path for
 * landing assets). A scene whose capture does not exist yet is `null`, and
 * the section renders without an image: a real frame or nothing, never a
 * placeholder pretending to be the product.
 *
 * Adding a screenshot: drop the reviewed PNG in content/assets/_inbox/, run
 * `make process-images CONTEXT=landing DESC=<scene>`, `make sync-assets`,
 * then paste the resulting URL here. Review every frame for identifiers
 * (account ids, emails, the workspace name, hostnames) before it leaves the
 * machine; the bucket is public.
