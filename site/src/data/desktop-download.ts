/**
 * THE single source of truth for where Planton Desktop is downloaded from.
 *
 * Every installer link on the site -- the install page, the landing page's
 * download button, the header link -- reads from here, the same law
 * src/data/pricing.ts applies to prices and src/data/positioning.ts to what
 * Planton is. A download URL typed anywhere else is a future dead link.
 *
 * The URLs point at the `latest` channel aliases on the downloads CDN. The
 * desktop release pipeline republishes these aliases on every stable release
 * (stripping the version from the per-version filename), so they are
 * version-free and always serve the current installer. That is what lets a
 * static site link to "the latest build" without knowing a version number:
 * the site never has to be rebuilt for a release.
 *
 * What the CDN also publishes, for the pieces that DO want a version:
 *   desktop/latest/version.txt        -> "v0.0.56" (plain text)
 *   desktop/<tag>/checksums.txt       -> the release's integrity contract
 * scripts/generate-desktop-release.mjs reads the pointer at build time and
 * writes src/generated/desktop-release.json; the page renders the version
 * badge and the checksums link only when that file carries a version.
 *
 * Per-platform `available` is a deliberate hand switch, not a computed fact:
 * it is flipped off when a published installer is known to be wrong (the
 * Windows alias once served a cache-warm build stamped 0.0.0-warm) and back
 * on once a release has proven the alias -- download it, read its version
 * resource, then flip. The site must never offer a link it knows is broken.
