/**
 * THE single source of positioning truth for the website.
 *
 * The product positioning follows a three-level rule, and this file exists
 * so the rule cannot drift the way the last one did (the "Vercel for
 * backend" line was coined for Service Hub, escaped its scope, and spent
 * six months describing the whole product):
 *
 *   Level 1 — Planton, the umbrella. Never uses an analogy.
 *   Level 2 — each hub gets exactly one analogy, and the analogy never
 *             escapes its hub. Infra Hub is "Cursor for Cloud
 *             Infrastructure"; Service Hub is "Vercel for Backend, In
 *             Your Own Cloud".
 *
 * Any sentence on the site that states what Planton IS must read from
 * here — the same law src/data/pricing.ts applies to prices.
 *
 * Vocabulary: "Infra Chart" is the product noun; "template" is the plain
 * word that explains it. Pair them on first mention, and never capitalize
 * "Template" as if it were a product name.
